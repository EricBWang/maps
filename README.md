# Maps
Maps is a project that develops a visualization of restaurant ratings in the Berkeley area by incorporating data types, data abstraction, sequences, dictionaries, and machine learning concepts. Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant. Each restaurant is represented by a dot whose color is determined by the restaurant's location.
